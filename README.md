# Screen-saver Demo Loader for "1995" Demo by kewlers and mfx

This simple Screen-saver will convert the **1995** demo by **kewlers** and **mfx**
to be usable as a "native" **Microsoft Windows** Screen-saver.

It supports some options (resolution, screen format, sound and FSAA).

It was publicly released on **October 19, 2007**.

## Usage

1. Download the [1995 original demo](http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=25783).
2. Unzip it in a `1995` directory, at the same level of the `scrnload.scr` proggy.

You should have now:

	  --\
		|_ scrnload.scr
		|_ 1995\
			|_test3d.exe
			|_ <some others files>

3. Then after doing this, you can move the `scrnload.scr` and the `1995` folder
in your `system32` directory. Then, right-click on the `scrnload.scr` and
select **Install**. You can configure the **Screen-saver Demo Loader** as you want
then.

**Note:** For **Win9x** users, you must move the `scrnload.scr` and the `1995`
demo in your `windows\system` directory. Also, if you want a friendly name for
the screen-saver, rename the `scrnload.scr` as `1995 Screen-saver.scr`. Password
Screen-saver protection should work too.
